# TypeGraphQL Boilerplate

GraphQL API Boilerplate for TypeORM + TypeGraphQL

Requirements:

- Make sure `redis` is installed

In GraphQL Playground, make sure that you set the `"request.credentials"` header to: ` "request.credentials": "same-origin"`
otherwise cookies won't work in the playground.
